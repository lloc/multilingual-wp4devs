# Multilingual WordPress for developers

This plugin is a companion to my talk “Multilingual WordPress for Developers”. It includes practical examples and techniques covered during the session, aimed at helping developers build multilingual WordPress websites confidently.

Discover how to make the most of WordPress’s internationalisation (i18n) and localisation (l10n) features, set up multilingual environments using multisite or plugins, and enhance your workflow with custom code — all focused on simplifying multilingual development.
